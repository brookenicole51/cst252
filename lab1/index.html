	<h1>Lab 1 - Getting Started</h1>
	<p>Summary of Efforts: This lab was relatively easy for me. I felt like it was mostly just a reminder of how to use html to get the content onto the page. Looking through the sites was very inspiring for what we could be able to accomplish in this class.</p>

<h2>1</h2>
<h3>https://obys.agency</h3>
	<img src="./img/web1.png" alt="">

	<p>This website had a small animation in the arrows throughout the site. When you scroll over the arrows directing you to the images it gives out small captions. I think something like this could be very interesting.</p>

<h2>2</h2>
<h3>https://www.heleneblanck.fr</h3>
	<img src="./img/web2.png" alt="">

	<p>The directory of this site had an interesting hover effect for the sections. Each section would give a highlighted piece of work when you would hover over it. I think something like this would be great to add to a portfolio or other works</p>

<h2>3</h2>
<h3>https://erikamoreira.co</h3>
	<img src="./img/web3.png" alt="">
	<img src="./img/web3_2.png" alt="">
	<p>Similarly to the previous webpage this page gives a peak into what will be in the section. This one has masked the image behind and then shows little pieces of it to create interest in the section. I think this one is very effectice and would be great to use.</p>
