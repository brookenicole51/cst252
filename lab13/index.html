    <h1>Lab 13: Conditionals</h1>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>I had struggles getting all of my results to sort correctly but have
			simplified my lab to get the proper results.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
    	<p>I had some issues with trying to do a little too much for this lab. I had
			thought of doing something in my own way to make it more interesting but
			I got distracted by the design and made me overwhellemed with my coding. Going
			back to the origninal method made this lab rather easy.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
