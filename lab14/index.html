			<h1>Lab 14 - Loops</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>The lab was not too challenges, with Wes' help, to get the FizzBuzz portion
				done but we had trouble getting the lab to actually print.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The string never printed for us so we had to eventually just give up.
				The code for my java witht he strings is working correctly but still no
				solution to printing.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We do not have any results besides the attached java script.</p>
