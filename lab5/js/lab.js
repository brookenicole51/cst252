//Declare variables to hold the make, model, color, and year of your vehicle, example, var year = 2004//

//Declare a boolean variable ownIt for whether you own it or not.//

//Once you declare them, reference them and see them printed out in the console.//

//Create a new variable age that subtracts the year from the current year.//

//Use console.log() to print the value of age, example, console.log("Age: " + age)//
