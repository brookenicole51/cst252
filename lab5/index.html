	<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>In this lab we are leared about how to use data types and
		variables. We learned how to use the console to test our JavaScript
		variables and check them using the log. Then, we addded those
		variables to our JavaScript in atom and output them using "document.writeln()".</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was rather straight forward and I enjoyed the logical take that
		was used within it. I did have a slight challenge remembering that
		the strings need quotations but the numbers do not.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>There are no problems left within this lab. I was did have a problem
		when I removed the variable tags in my JavaScript as was showed in the
		screenshots from the Lab file.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Below are the results of my JavaScript. I was able to easily get this
		displayed on the page with little to no problems.</p>
