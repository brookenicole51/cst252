	<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p></p>
				In this lab I had some problems in the console remebering which brackets are
				tied to each variable type. I was unsure if the square brackets or curled
				brackets. After some thought I remembered which brackets are responsible
				for which variable. Overall there was not much to get in place for this
				lab and I have found the details of Java that we have learned rather interesting.
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p></p>
				I am still having an issue with getting the return for my object to look quite right.
				I used the method that Wes had put in the lab directions but it returns the results with
				the curly brackets and quotes around everything. I am unsure why this is happening and
				have tried to change the quotations and spacing to fix the issue but it will not fix the
				problem. I then took a look at Wes' website and found that his results looked the same as
				mine so I wound up leaving the problem as it was.

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p></p>
				Below are the outputs for the Java that I created for this lab. I am still frustrated
				with the formate that my object is returned in but besides that am glad I am getting the
				hang of this lab and can set my script correctly.
