			<h1>Lab 19 - AJAX</h1>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was learning how to work with Ajax and
					APIs to get random results.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was a little problematic to get working. I could not
					figure out how to change the target URL. I could only get it working
					with the numbers API. All other APIs that I found did not output
					a string but multiple strings of data and would not print in the output.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is my button that will display the results.</p>
