			<h1>Lab 15 - Basic Debugging</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My biggest challenge throughout the semester was with lab 14. I had not
			been able to get it to print.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>This lab has now been fixed after talking to classmates and my partner
			about what they had done to get it to work.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
