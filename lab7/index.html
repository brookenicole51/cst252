	<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>In this lab I had some trouble getting the name to appear at all.
		The issue that I found was that I had not been using the console log
		correctly. I had been using document.writeln where I should have used
		the console.log. After chatting with my partner I was able to fix the issue.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I have not gotten this lab to look how I had hopped due to a lack of time.
		The neccessary tasks were finished but the formatting was not great.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Overall, I am happy I was able to get the assigned task done adequetly. I
		wish I could have gotten it looking better but overall I am pleased with the result.</p>
