		<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab was a little challenging to figure out how to change CSS attributes
			within my java. I had to do a little research to figure out what I could change and
			how to write the commands.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I am still having a problem of changing individual elements within the java scripts.
			I wanted to add padding between my buttons or change their positioning somehow but
			I could not figure out how to do so. Eventually I found that it was another element That
			I was able to easily alter within my js.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Overall, I am happy with what I was able to do and that I feel like I am
			getting more of a grasp on how to write what I am trying to command. Below
			are the buttons that I created.</p>
