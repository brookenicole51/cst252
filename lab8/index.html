	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had a a challenge with simple things for this lab. The biggest Challenge
		I had was writing results pluar instead of result which was not retreving
		the information in the console. After fixing this the lab was not too hard.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I do not have any problems for this. I was able to get everything working
		correctly. This lab was rather interesting I just need some more practice
		to feel comfortable with what I need to do where.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Below are the results that I was able to get.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Original Array: 345, 97, 432, 8 ,43</p>
		<p>Array plus 5: 350, 102, 437, 13, 48</p>
		<p>Array times 5: 1725, 485, 2160, 40, 215</p>
